How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  The method I can use to interpret user needs is to listen to the user and write down what functionality they are requesting.
  Then I can break down the request into a feature and what functions the feature should have.
  Creating user stories helps by taking what the user has said and writing my interpretations of their request and seeing if they are the same or if there are differences.
  Creating user stories can also help implement features from user requests because the user stories are communicated to other members of the team.
  The team can then take these user stories to create test cases and develop code that implements the functionality requested from the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  The approach I take to developing programs is to work on each feature as I think of them and to work on the feature until it is completed.
  An agile process I can incorporate into my future development work is the user stories to organize the features needed for my program.
  I could also incorporate test cases into my development to ensure the features I am working on are functioning correctly.


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member means to be able to communicate with other members whether it is to talk about progress being made, issues I am having, or to offer advice to other members of the team.
To be a good team member also means to be able to work together with other members to accomplish our mutual goals.
