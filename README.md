How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  The method I can use to interpret user needs is to listen to the user and write down what functionality they are requesting.
  Then I can break down the request into a feature and what functions the feature should have.
  Creating user stories helps by taking what the user has said and writing my interpretations of their request and seeing if they are the same or if there are differences.
  Creating user stories can also help implement features from user requests because the user stories are communicated to other members of the team.
  The team can then take these user stories to create test cases and develop code that implements the functionality requested from the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?



What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
